  <h3>My Web Development Journey</h3>
  <table cellspacing="50">

    <td>
      <p> At some point when I was a little kid, my uncle Bret purchased me a domain with my very own name! <br>
        Unbeknownst to me, this would propel me into a fascination with computers, wesbites, and how exactly what was emerging as Web2.0 worked. <br>
        I was (un)fortunate enough to be born in an era where the internet was convienent, easily accessible, and tailored to the consumer experience. <br>
        However, this created an interesting dilemma in which modern web design seemed unattainable, at least in the face of old sites from a decade before my time <br>
        The summer before I began middle school, my uncle informed me of the domain I had in my name (JacobAlteri.com). <br>
        I was fascinated with the idea of being able to show my friends my very own Wesbite!<br>
        The only thing it contained for years was "Hey Jacob, call your uncle when you see this".<br>
        That summer I spent so much time attempting to write a cool and unique website, and to show it off when I went back to school.<br>
        I wish I still had an image of that original site! <br>
        After that, my love of coding and designing dimished. It was simply too confusing for me to understand anything beyond basic HTML as a kid.<br>
        As time went on, I pursued coding in small little obsessive spells. <br>Designing a Snake Game in Python,
        learning small tidbits here and there of C level language to get games to work in Unity, <br>
        engaging in coding competitions hosted by UK (The college I eventually enrolled at!) all kept my love for coding there, but at a proverbial distance.<br>
        Coding had always been a fun little hobby to me, but it wasn't until highschool that I really started to view it as a possible career option.<br>
        <strong> <br> <br>For me, coding and computer science gives me the ability to create something tangible to be proud of, <br>which not many professions can offer while also engaging in a high level of theoretical ideas.
          <br>This is why I so intimately love Computer Science, and do what I do.</strong>
